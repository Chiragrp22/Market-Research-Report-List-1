<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermally Modified Wood Boards Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermo-S</li><li>Thermo-D</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Thermally Modified Wood Boards Market includes two main types: Thermo-S and Thermo-D. Thermo-S boards are created using a steam treatment process, which involves heating the wood to a high temperature, making it less susceptible to decay and insect infestation. Thermo-D boards, on the other hand, undergo a kiln drying process, which removes moisture from the wood and enhances its durability and stability. Both types of thermally modified wood boards provide superior performance, extended lifespan, and reduced maintenance requirements compared to traditional wood products.</p></p>
