<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Explosion Sensitizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Physical Sensitizer</li><li>Chemosensitizers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Explosion sensitizers are substances used in various industries to make explosive materials less sensitive to accidental ignition. There are two main types: physical sensitizers and chemosensitizers. Physical sensitizers modify the physical properties of the explosive material to reduce sensitivity, while chemosensitizers alter the chemical composition to achieve the same effect. Physical sensitizers often involve encapsulating or coating the explosive material, while chemosensitizers involve adding certain chemicals to reduce the reactivity. Both these types help enhance safety by minimizing the risk of unplanned explosions in industrial settings.</p></p>
