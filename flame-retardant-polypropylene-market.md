<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant Polypropylene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Halogen Flame Retardant PP</li><li>Halogen Free Flame Retardant PP</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The market for flame retardant polypropylene can be classified into two types: halogen flame retardant PP and halogen-free flame retardant PP. Halogen flame retardant PP is a type of polypropylene that contains halogen compounds, such as bromine or chlorine, which act as flame retardants. On the other hand, halogen-free flame retardant PP is free from such halogen compounds and instead utilizes alternative flame retardant additives. Both types serve the purpose of reducing the flammability of polypropylene materials, but they differ in terms of their chemical compositions and environmental impact.</p></p>
