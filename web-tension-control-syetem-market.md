<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Web Tension Control Syetem Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop System</li><li>Closed Loop System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>A Web Tension Control System is used to maintain consistent tension in material (such as paper, film, or fabric) during the web processing and production. There are two main market types for this system: Open Loop System and Closed Loop System. In an Open Loop System, tension is controlled based on preset values without feedback from the web, which can lead to inaccuracies. In contrast, a Closed Loop System continuously measures tension through sensors, providing real-time feedback for precise tension control, resulting in higher accuracy and quality.</p></p>
