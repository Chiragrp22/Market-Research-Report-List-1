<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil-air Coolers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-type</li><li>Dry-type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Oil-air coolers are used to dissipate heat in various applications, such as engines and industrial machinery. The market comprises two main types: oil-type and dry-type coolers. Oil-type coolers utilize oil as a coolant, circulating it through a heat exchanger to remove heat and subsequently cooling it with air. This type is commonly used in power plants and heavy machinery. Dry-type coolers, on the other hand, use air directly as a coolant, without the need for circulating oil. These coolers are often found in HVAC systems and electrical transformers.</p></p>
