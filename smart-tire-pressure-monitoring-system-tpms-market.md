<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System</li><li>Direct Tire Pressure Monitoring System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Smart Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) market includes two main types: Indirect TPMS and Direct TPMS. Indirect TPMS uses the wheel speed sensors in an anti-lock braking system to estimate tire pressure, while Direct TPMS uses pressure sensors on each tire to provide accurate and real-time readings. Indirect TPMS is typically less expensive but may not provide as precise measurements as Direct TPMS. Direct TPMS, on the other hand, offers more accurate readings but is usually more expensive to install and maintain.</p></p>
