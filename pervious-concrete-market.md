<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pervious Concrete Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>20% ± 5% Voids(Low Porosity, High Strength)</li><li>30% ± 5% Voids(High Porosity, Low Strength)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pervious concrete is available in two market types: low porosity, high strength (with 20% ± 5% voids) and high porosity, low strength (with 30% ± 5% voids). The first type has a lower porosity which allows for less water to pass through but offers greater strength. On the other hand, the second type has a higher porosity which allows for more water to pass through but offers lower strength. These different market types cater to various applications and project requirements where either strength or drainage capability is prioritized.</p></p>
