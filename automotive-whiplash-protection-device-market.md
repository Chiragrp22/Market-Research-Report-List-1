<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Whiplash Protection Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Backrests</li><li>Head Restraints</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive whiplash protection devices are designed to minimize the risk of whiplash injuries in vehicle occupants during rear-end collisions. Backrests and head restraints are two types of these devices. Backrests provide support to the driver and passengers' upper body and help prevent excessive backward movement during a collision. Head restraints, on the other hand, protect the neck and prevent the head from violently moving backward, reducing the chances of whiplash. Both these devices are essential in ensuring the safety and well-being of individuals in the event of a rear-end collision.</p></p>
