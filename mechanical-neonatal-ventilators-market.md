<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical neonatal ventilators are devices used for providing respiratory support to newborn babies who have difficulty breathing on their own. The market for these ventilators can be divided into two types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators deliver mechanical assistance through an endotracheal tube that is inserted into the baby's airway, while non-invasive ventilators provide support through nasal prongs or masks, without the need for intubation. Both types aim to deliver oxygen and maintain proper ventilation to ensure the baby's respiratory system functions effectively.</p></p>
