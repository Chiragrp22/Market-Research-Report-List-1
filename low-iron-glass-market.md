<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low-Iron Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolled Glass</li><li>Float Glass</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Low-iron glass is available in two market types: rolled glass and float glass. Rolled glass is made by pouring a molten mixture of silica and other chemicals onto a metal conveyor belt, and then rolling it into a flat sheet using a pair of metal rollers. This process produces glass with a slightly wavy surface. On the other hand, float glass is created by pouring the molten glass onto a bed of molten tin, which creates a perfectly flat and smooth surface. This makes float glass more suitable for applications where clarity is crucial, such as windows and display screens.</p></p>
