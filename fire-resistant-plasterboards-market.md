<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire-Resistant Plasterboards Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tapered-Edged</li><li>Square-Edged</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Fire-resistant plasterboards are widely used in construction to provide protection against fire. There are two main types available in the market: tapered-edged and square-edged. Tapered-edged plasterboards have beveled edges, making it easier to conceal the joints and create a smooth finish when they are installed together. On the other hand, square-edged plasterboards have straight edges, requiring the use of jointing tape and compound to hide the joints. Both types offer excellent fire resistance properties, ensuring the safety of the building and its occupants in the event of a fire.</p></p>
