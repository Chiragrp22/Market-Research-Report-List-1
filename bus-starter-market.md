<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bus Starter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Control</li><li>Electromagnetic Control</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The bus starter market can be categorized into two types: direct control and electromagnetic control. In direct control, the starter motor directly engages with the engine and is controlled by a mechanical switch or lever. This type of starter is commonly found in older models of buses. On the other hand, electromagnetic control utilizes an electromagnetic solenoid to engage the starter motor with the engine. This type of starter is more common in modern buses and offers smoother and more efficient engine starting.</p></p>
