<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Inkjet Printhead Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piezoelectric Type</li><li>Thermal Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The commercial inkjet printhead market is segregated into two types: piezoelectric type and thermal type. Piezoelectric printheads use electric current to create pressure, causing ink droplets to be ejected onto the printing material. These printheads offer precise control over ink drop size, resulting in high-quality prints. On the other hand, thermal printheads work by heating the ink, creating a bubble that pushes the ink onto the paper. This type of printhead is commonly found in consumer-grade printers due to its cost-effectiveness and faster printing speeds.</p></p>
