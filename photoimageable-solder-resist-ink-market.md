<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoimageable Solder Resist Ink Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Based</li><li>Non Solvent Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solvent-based solder resist ink is a type of ink that uses organic solvents to dissolve its pigments and binders. This type of ink provides good adhesion and coverage on the substrate surface but may release harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during the drying process. On the other hand, non-solvent based solder resist ink does not contain organic solvents and instead uses water or other non-volatile substances as carriers. This type of ink is more environmentally friendly and is commonly used in areas where VOC emissions are regulated or restricted.</p></p>
