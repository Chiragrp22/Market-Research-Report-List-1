<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Asphalt Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Petroleum Asphalt</li><li>Natural Asphalt</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Road asphalt is categorized into two types: petroleum asphalt and natural asphalt. Petroleum asphalt is derived from crude oil and is the most commonly used type in road construction. It is produced through a refining process, making it more versatile and easily adaptable to various weather conditions. Natural asphalt, on the other hand, is a naturally occurring material found in deposits. It is typically used in areas where petroleum asphalt is not readily available. The choice between these two types depends on availability, cost, and specific project requirements.</p></p>
