<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully automated</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) are portable devices that deliver an electric shock to restore the heart's normal rhythm in case of sudden cardiac arrest. The market for AEDs consists of two types: semi-automated and fully automated. Semi-automated AEDs require the user to initiate the shock by pressing a button after analyzing the heart rhythm. Meanwhile, fully automated AEDs automatically determine the need for a shock and deliver it without user intervention. Both types aim to increase the chances of survival by providing prompt and efficient defibrillation.</p></p>
