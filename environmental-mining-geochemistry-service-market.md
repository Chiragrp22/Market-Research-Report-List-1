<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Environmental Mining Geochemistry Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laboratory Based</li><li>In-field Based</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The environmental mining geochemistry service market can be categorized into two types: laboratory-based and in-field based. In the laboratory-based market, samples are collected from the mining site and sent to a laboratory for analysis. This allows for precise and accurate measurements, but it can be time-consuming and costly. On the other hand, in the in-field based market, portable equipment is used to collect and analyze samples directly at the mining site. This approach offers faster results but may have a slightly lower level of accuracy compared to laboratory-based analysis.</p></p>
