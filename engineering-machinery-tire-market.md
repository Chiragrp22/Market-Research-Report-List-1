<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Engineering Machinery Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Tire</li><li>Radial Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bias tire and radial tire are two types of tires used in the engineering machinery market. Bias tires are made by layering rubber-coated plies diagonally from bead to bead, offering excellent load-bearing capacity and durability. They are cost-effective but have a rough ride and generate more heat. On the other hand, radial tires have plies that run radially from bead to bead, providing better fuel efficiency, smoother ride, and heat dissipation. However, they are comparatively expensive. Both types have their own advantages and disadvantages, making them suitable for different applications.</p></p>
