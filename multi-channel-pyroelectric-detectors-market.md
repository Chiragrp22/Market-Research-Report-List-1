<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multi Channel Pyroelectric Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two Channel Detector</li><li>Four Channel Detector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multi-channel pyroelectric detectors are a type of sensors used for detecting infrared radiation. A two-channel detector consists of two separate channels that enable the measurement of different wavelengths simultaneously. This allows for more accurate and precise measurements. On the other hand, a four-channel detector has four individual channels, enabling the measurement of a broader spectrum of infrared radiation. This provides even higher accuracy and flexibility in detecting and analyzing various sources of infrared radiation. Both types of detectors find applications in fields such as spectroscopy, gas analysis, and non-contact temperature measurements.</p></p>
