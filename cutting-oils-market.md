<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cutting Oils Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Soluble Cutting Oils</li><li>Neat Cutting Oils</li></ul></p>
<p><p>There are two main types of cutting oils in the market: water soluble cutting oils and neat cutting oils. Water soluble cutting oils are mixed with water to form an emulsion, making them easier to clean and dispose of. They are commonly used in machining operations. Neat cutting oils, on the other hand, are not mixed with water and are used in undiluted form. They provide better lubrication and cooling properties, making them suitable for heavy-duty cutting applications. Both types of cutting oils have their advantages and are chosen based on specific requirements.</p></p>
