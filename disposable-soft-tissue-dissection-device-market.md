<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disposable Soft Tissue Dissection Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bipolar</li><li>Monopolar</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Disposable Soft Tissue Dissection Device market includes two main types: bipolar and monopolar. Bipolar devices use two electrodes that work together to deliver energy, allowing for precise tissue dissection and sealing of blood vessels. Monopolar devices, on the other hand, use a single electrode that delivers energy through the patient's body to an inactive grounding pad. Both types are helpful in surgical procedures as they provide efficient and safe tissue dissection capabilities, but they differ in terms of the number of electrodes used and the energy delivery mechanism.</p></p>
