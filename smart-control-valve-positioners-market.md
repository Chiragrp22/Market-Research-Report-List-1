<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Control Valve Positioners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting Positioners</li><li>Double Acting Positioners</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Smart control valve positioners are devices used in industrial automation to precisely control the opening and closing of control valves. Single acting positioners are designed for valves that require air pressure to open or close; they operate by either increasing or decreasing the air pressure. On the other hand, double acting positioners are used for valves that require air pressure both to open and close the valve. They provide dynamic control by adjusting the air pressure based on the desired valve position.</p></p>
