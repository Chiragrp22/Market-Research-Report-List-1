<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marek\'s Disease Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bivalent Vaccine</li><li>Monovalent Vaccine</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Marek's disease vaccine market consists of two types: bivalent vaccine and monovalent vaccine. A bivalent vaccine provides protection against two different strains of Marek's disease virus, while a monovalent vaccine only protects against one specific strain. Bivalent vaccines are preferred when multiple strains are prevalent in a particular region, as they offer broader protection. On the other hand, monovalent vaccines are suitable for areas where only one strain is predominant. The choice between these two types depends on the prevalence and distribution of specific Marek's disease virus strains in a given area.</p></p>
