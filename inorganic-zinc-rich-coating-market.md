<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inorganic Zinc Rich Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent-based Coatings</li><li>Water-based Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The inorganic zinc rich coating market is segmented into two types: solvent-based coatings and water-based coatings. Solvent-based coatings are formulated with organic solvents as the medium to disperse the zinc particles. They provide excellent adhesion, corrosion resistance, and durability to the coated surface. However, they emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during application. On the other hand, water-based coatings use water as the medium to disperse the zinc particles. They are environmentally friendly, emit lower VOCs, and offer good adhesion and corrosion resistance properties.</p></p>
